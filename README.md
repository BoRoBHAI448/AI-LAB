# Maze Solver using IDDFS

## Overview
This project implements a maze solver using Iterative Deepening Depth-First Search (IDDFS) in Python. The goal is to determine if a valid path exists from a start position to a target position in a maze represented by a 2D grid.

## Problem Description
Given a 2D grid representing a maze, where each cell is either an empty space (0) or a wall (1), the program will find a path from a start cell to a target cell using IDDFS.
